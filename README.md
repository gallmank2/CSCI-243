# My Project  

This project is like one that may already contain existing code you are asked to work with.  Pretend that this file is a source code file you need to edit.  

You can easily make changes:
1) Stage the changes with `git add` or `git rm`
2) Commit them using `git commit`
3) Push them using `git push`

*Don't forget* to submit the link on blackboard, I must receive a blackboard submission with the link to your git repository for grading.  This link looks like `https://www.github.com/winthropuniversity-besmer/some-assignment-yourname`

This change is meant to show my understanding of *github* and how to **navigate through the site** as well as adjustments.
